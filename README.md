## Installation requirements

Before you start to read how to install the project you'll need these requirements:
>[!NOTE]
>If you can't install xampp, look for any other local server that supports **MySQL** and **PHP**
***

1. XAMPP

2. Install Composer

3. Install NPM in Node.js

4. Xdebug (for the tests coverage)

5. Postman
***

## :scroll: Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
https://github.com/Matias-Stadler/SearchJob.git
```

2. Install **Composer** and **NPM**
```
composer install
```
```
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file copying everything inside the existing file .env.example and modify the following lines:
* DB_CONNECTION=mysql
* DB_DATABASE=jobSearch

4. Create a database in **MySQL**

5. Now go to the VSC terminal and put the following command
```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
This command will generate all the tables.

6. Open another terminal in **VSC** and put the following command
```
npm run dev
```

7. Open another terminal and run the server with this command
```
php artisan serve
```
You'll see an url that is going to take you to a website.

>[!IMPORTANT]
